# Data-Warehouse-and-Analytics-Using-SQL-and-Tableau

This GitHub repository contains the documentation and data for the Data Warehouse and Analytics Using SQL and Tableau project. I created a comprehensive data warehouse based on a provided database containing 11 tables related to company operations. Using this warehouse, I generated insightful SQL queries and Tableau visualizations to aid decision-making for company management.

## Project Overview

- **Data Warehouse Creation**: Designed a data warehouse by selecting and aggregating data from at least six of the provided tables.
- **Insightful SQL Queries**: Developed eight complex SQL queries to extract meaningful information for company decision-making.
- **Tableau Visualizations**: Created five individual visualizations and one dashboard in Tableau to visually represent key data insights.

## Features

- **Consumer Data Warehouse**: Incorporates data from seven tables - Customers, Orders, Order_details, Products, Shippers, Employees, and Categories.
- **Complex SQL Queries**: Answers various business questions like identifying price-sensitive customers, analyzing purchasing power by country, and assessing product preferences.
- **Tableau Dashboard and Visualizations**: Includes geographic visualization maps, product category sales, and purchase power comparisons to aid strategic decisions.

## Usage

- **Data Warehouse**: View the SQL code and screenshots of the data warehouse for an understanding of the structure and content.
- **SQL Queries**: Each query is documented with its purpose and findings, providing insights into customer behavior and company performance.
- **Tableau Visualizations**: Analyze the visualizations to understand sales trends, customer distribution, product popularity, and more.

## Project Components

- **Data Warehouse Description**: Detailed description and screenshot of the data warehouse tracking company metrics.
- **SQL Queries and Results**: Documentation of each query, including the code, result screenshots, and analysis.
- **Tableau Visualizations**: Individual visualizations and a combined dashboard, with explanations of their significance and potential impacts on decision-making.
